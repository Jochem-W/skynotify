# Skynotify

A containerised service that provides real-time push notifications for Bluesky
posts, officially hosted on [skynotify.co](https://skynotify.co/) and easily
self-hostable.

## Installing

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose
2. Clone or download the repository
3. Create a Firebase project with Cloud Messaging turned on
4. Copy `example.env` to `.env` and fill in the empty values
5. Place Firebase Admin SDK credentials in `server/firebase.json`
6. Run `docker compose build`
7. Run `docker compose up -d`

The service will now be running in the background. To make the service
accessible from the outside on port 80, the following can be added to `app` in
`docker-compose.yml`:

```yml
ports:
  - "80:3000"
```

### InfluxDB

For monitoring and statistics, InfluxDB has been integrated into the Compose
file and Go application. The amount and types of notifications sent and the
amount of operations processed from the Bluesky firehose are stored for
displaying in a graph. This latter is also used to keep track of the last
processed commit, which allows for the application to be restarted without
dropping notifications.

that I'll have the time to keep up with everything. To start contributing,
you'll need to install the following:
